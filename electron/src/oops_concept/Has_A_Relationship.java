 * Aggregation vs Composition

Dependency: Aggregation implies a relationship where the child can exist independently of the parent. For example, Bank and Employee, delete the Bank and the Employee still exist. whereas Composition implies a relationship where the child cannot exist independent of the parent. Example: Human and heart, heart don’t exist separate to a Human
Type of Relationship: Aggregation relation is “has-a” and composition is “part-of” relation.
Type of association: Composition is a strong Association whereas Aggregation is a weak Association.
