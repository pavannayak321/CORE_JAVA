/*
 * two methods are said  to be overloaded iff method names are same but arguments are different 
 * 
 * ------->Lack of overloading concept in c-language is increases the programmer complexity 
 * 			change in method argument we should go for the new [function_Name]  in c-language
 * 
 *  			abs()----->int
 *  			labs()----->long
 *  			fabs()------>float Type 
 *  
 *  
 *  				but in case of the java we don't need to go for the new function_name 
 *  			
 *  			abs(int)------>int
 *  			abs(long)------>long
 *  			abs(float)-----float
 *  	**@*@*@IN OVERLOADING MORE SPECIFIC VERSION  WILL GET HE HIGHEST PRIORITY ***@*@*@*@*@*@
