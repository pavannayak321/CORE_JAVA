Collections in Java
A Collection is a group of individual objects represented as a single unit.
 Java provides Collection Framework which defines several classes and interfaces to represent a group of objects as a single unit.

The Collection interface (java.util.Collection) and Map interface (java.util.Map) are two main root interfaces of Java collection classes.

Need for Collection Framework :

Before Collection Framework (or before JDK 1.2) was introduced,
 the standard methods for grouping Java objects (or collections) were array or Vector or HashTable.
  All three of these collections had no common interface.
For example, if we want to access elements of array, vector or HashTable.
 All these three have different methods and syntax for accessing members
