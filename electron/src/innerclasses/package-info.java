 * sometimes we can declare a class inside another , such type of classes are called "INNER CLASSES"
 * 
 * inner class concept was introduced in 1.1 version to fix GUI bugs
 * 
 * [[without existing  one type of object if there is no chance of existing another type of object then ,we should go for "INNER CLASSES"]]
 * 
 * class Car
 * 	{
 * 		--------
 * 		--------
 * 		class Wheel
 * 		{
 * 			========
 * 			========
 * 		}
 * 		--------
 * 	}
 * 
 *relation between outer class and inner class is not [IS-A] relationship it is an [HAS-A] relationship
 *
 *based on the purpose & position of the class declaration inner classes are divided into four types 
 *
 *			(1)	normal (or) regular inner classes 
 *
 *			(2)	method local inner classes 
 *
 *			(3)	anonymous inner classes 
 *
 *			(4)	static nested inner classes
